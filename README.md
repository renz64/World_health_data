This is a data analysis project that I have written in Python using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn. This project analyzes the health expenditure statistics across the world, and generates a simplified model to classify countries into developed and the rest. The data were taken from the Gapminder Health Economics datasets.
